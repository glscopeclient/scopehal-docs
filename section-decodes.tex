\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Key Concepts}

ngscopeclient and libscopehal are based on a ``filter graph" architecture internally. The filter graph is a directed
acyclic graph with a set of source nodes (waveforms captured from hardware, loaded from a saved session, or generated
numerically) and sink nodes (waveform views, protocol analyzer views, and statistics) connected by edges representing
data flow.

A filter is simply an intermediate node in the graph, which takes input from zero or more waveform nodes and outputs a
waveform which may be displayed, used as input to other filters, or both. A waveform is a series of data points which
may represent voltages, digital samples, or arbitrarily complex protocol data structures.

As a result, there is no internal distinction between math functions, measurements, and protocol decodes, and it is
possible to chain them arbitrarily. Consider the following example:

\begin{itemize}
\item Two analog waveforms representing serial data and clock are acquired
\item Each analog waveform is thresholded, producing a digital waveform
\item The two digital waveforms are decoded as $I^2C$, producing a series of packets
\item The $I^2C$ packets are decoded as writes to a serial DAC, producing an analog waveform
\item A moving average filter is applied to the analog waveform
\item A measurement filter finds the instantaneous frequency of each cycle of the DAC output
\end{itemize}

In this document we use the term ``filter" consistently to avoid ambiguity.

\subsection{Conventions}

A filter can take arbitrarily many inputs (vector inputs), arbitrarily many parameters (scalar inputs), and outputs a
signal (vector output).

If the output signal is a multi-field type (as opposed to a single scalar, e.g. voltage, at each sample) the
``Output Signal" section will include a table describing how various types of output data are displayed. Printf-style
format codes may be used for clarity. For example, ``\%02x" means data is formatted as hexadecimal bytes with leading
zeroes.

All filters with complex output use a standardized set of colors to display various types of data fields in a
consistent manner. These colors are configurable under the \menustyle{Appearance / Decodes} preferences category.

\section{128b/130b}
\label{filter:128b130b}

Decodes the 128b/130b line code used by PCIe gen 3/4/5. This filter performs block alignment and descrambling, but no
decoding of block contents.

128b/130b, as a close relative of \hyperref[filter:128b130b]{64b/66b}, is a serial line code which divides transmitted
data into 128-bit blocks and scrambles them with a LFSR, then appends a 2-bit type field (which is not scrambled) to
each block for synchronization. Block synchronization depends on always having an edge in the type field so types 2'b00
and 2'b11 are disallowed.

For PCIe over 128b/130b, block type 2'b01 contains 128 bits of upper layer protocol data while block type 2'b10
contains an ordered set.

Note that this filter only performs block alignment and descrambling. No decoding or parsing is applied to the 128-bit
blocks, other than searching for skip ordered sets (beginning with 0xaa) and using them for scrambler synchronization.

\section{64b/66b}
\label{filter:64b66b}

Decodes the 64/66b line code used by \hyperref[filter:10gbaser]{10Gbase-R} and other serial protocols, as originally
specified in IEEE 802.3 clause 49.2.

64b/66b is a serial line code which divides transmitted data into 64-bit blocks and scrambles them with a LFSR, then
appends a 2-bit type field (which is not scrambled) to each block for synchronization. Block synchronization depends on
always having an edge in the type field so types 2'b00 and 2'b11 are disallowed.

Note that this filter only performs block alignment and descrambling. No decoding is applied to the 64-bit blocks, as
different upper-layer protocols assign different meaning to them. In 10Gbase-R, type 2'b01 denotes ``64 bits of upper
layer data" and type 2'b10 denotes ``8-bit type field and 56 bits of data whose meaning depends on the type", however
this is not universal.

\section{8B/10B (IBM)}
\label{filter:8b10b}

Decodes the standard 8b/10b line code used by SGMII, \hyperref[filter:1000basex]{1000base-X}, DisplayPort, JESD204,
\hyperref[filter:pcie2_logical]{PCIe gen 1/2}, SATA, USB 3.0, and many other common serial protocols.

8b/10b is a dictionary based code which converts each byte of message data to a ten-bit code. In order to maintain DC
balance and limit run length to a maximum of five identical bits in a row, all legal codes have one of:
\begin{itemize}
\item One legal coding, with exactly five zero bits
\item Two legal codings, one with four zero bits and one with six
\end{itemize}

The transmitter maintains a ``running disparity" counter and chooses the appropriate coding for each symbol to ensure
DC balance. There are twelve legal codes which are not needed for encoding data values; these are used to encode
frame boundaries, idle/alignment sequences, and other control information.

\section{8B/10B (TMDS)}
\label{filter:tmds}

Decodes the 8-to-10 Transition Minimized Differential Signalling line code used in \hyperref[filter:dvi]{DVI} and
\hyperref[filter:hdmi]{HDMI}.

Like the \hyperref[filter:8b10b]{8B/10B (IBM)} line code, TMDS is an 8-to-10 bit serial line code. TMDS, however, is
designed to \emph{minimize} the number of toggles in the data stream for EMC reasons, rendering it difficult to
synchronize a CDR PLL to. As a result, HDMI and DVI provide a reference clock at the pixel clock rate (1/10 the serial
data bit rate) along with the data stream to provide synchronization.

\section{AC Couple}
\label{filter:accouple}

Automatically removes a DC offset from an analog waveform by subtracting the average of all samples from each sample.

This filter should only be used in postprocessing already acquired data, or other situations in which AC coupling in
the hardware (via an AC coupled probe, or coaxial DC block) is not possible.

\subsection{Output Signal}

If both inputs are vectors, this filter outputs a waveform containing the pairwise sum; i.e. sample $i$ of the output
is $a[i] + b[i]$. No resampling is performed on the inputs so incorrect or unexpected results may occur if they do not
share the same timebase.

If both inputs are scalars, this filter outputs their sum.

If one input is a vector and the other is a scalar, this filter outputs the sum  of the scalar and each element of the
waveform, i.e. sample $i$ of the output is $a + b[i]$ for the scalar + vector case and $a[i] + b$ for the vector +
scalar.

\section{Area Under Curve}

TODO: needs to be updated when we port to scalar interface

Measures the area under the curve by integrating the data points. By default, area measured above ground is considered
as positive and area measured below the ground is considered negative. The negative area can also be considered as positive
by changing a filter parameter. The measurement can be performed on the full record or on each cycle.

\section{Autocorrelation}
\label{filter:autocorrelation}

This filter calculates the autocorrelation of an analog waveform. Autocorrelation is a measure of self-similarity
calculated by multiplying the signal with a time-shifted copy of itself. In Fig. \ref{filter_autocorr}, strong peaks
can be seen at multiples of the 8b/10b symbol rate.

For best performance, it is crucial to keep the maximum offset as low as possible, since filter run time grows linearly
with offset range.

\section{Channel Emulation}
\label{filter:channelemu}

This filter models the effects of applying an arbitrary channel, described via a single path of a set of S-parameters,
to a waveform. Fig. \ref{filter_channelemu} shows the result of passing a 1.25 Gbps serial data pattern through S21 of
a 10x oscilloscope probe with approximately 500 MHz bandwidth. The ISI, attenuation, and phase shift introduced by the
channel can all be seen.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\bigimage{images/filters/channel-emulation.png}
\caption{Example of channel emulation on a serial data stream}
\label{filter_channelemu}
\end{figure}

The channel model works in the frequency domain. An FFT is performed on the input, then each complex point is scaled by
the interpolated magnitude and rotated by the phase, then an inverse FFT is used to transform the signal back into the
time domain.

The group delay of the channel is then estimated and samples are discarded from the beginning of the waveform to
prevent causality violations. For example, when performing channel emulation using a network with a 1ns group delay,
the output waveform will begin 1ns after the input (since the channel output before this depends on input samples
before the start of the waveform). Note that the automatic group delay estimation uses points from roughly the center
of the S-parameter dataset in the current implementation; channels which do not have a significant passband around this
frequency will give incorrect group delay estimates. The ``Group Delay Truncation Mode" parameter can be set to manual
in this case, selecting the ``Group Delay Truncation" parameter instead of the automatically estimated value.

By choosing appropriate stimulus waveforms and S-parameter paths, many different kinds of analysis can be performed.
For example, given a 4-port network describing two transmission lines (with ports 1 and 3 as input, and 2 and 4 as
output):
\begin{itemize}
\item Applying $S_{11}$ to a step or impulse waveform gives TDR response of the port 1-2 channel.
\item Applying $S_{21}$ to an impulse waveform gives impulse response of the port 1-2 channel
\item Applying $S_{21}$ to a serial data stream gives the port 1-2 signal as it would be seen by a receiver
\item Applying $S_{31}$ to a serial data stream gives the NEXT between the port 1-2 and 3-4 channels
\item Applying $S_{41}$ to a serial data stream gives the FEXT between the port 1-2 and 3-4 channels
\end{itemize}

Note that only the single S-parameter path provided is considered, and reflections elsewhere in the system are not
modeled. As a result, multiple applications of this filter to emulate a large circuit piecewise (for example, a cable
followed by a fixture) may give inaccurate results since reflections between the two networks are not considered. In
this situation, it is preferable to use a circuit simulator or the S-Parameter Cascade filter to calculate combined
S-parameters of the entire circuit and then perform the channel emulation once.

\section{Clock Recovery (D-PHY HS Mode)}

Extracts a double-rate clock from a MIPI D-PHY clock+data stream, which is gated to only toggle when the data input
is in HS mode. This can be used for generating eye patterns of the HS-mode data.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\pagebreak
\section{Clock Recovery (PLL)}
\label{filter:cdrpll}

This filter uses a PLL to recover a clock from a serial data stream. The recovered clock is double-rate and
phased 90\textdegree with respect to the data, such that the data can be sampled directly by both edges of the PLL
output clock.

When the optional clock gating input is low, the output does not toggle and any edges in the input signal are ignored.
As soon as the gate goes high, the PLL will phase shift the internal NCO to align with the next transition in the input
signal and then begin running closed-loop.

NOTE: The current edge detector uses a single threshold suitable for NRZ inputs. When using a multi-level modulation
such as PAM-4 or MLT-3, set the threshold to the highest or lowest crossing level. This will work fine for MLT-3 but
introduces some data-dependent jitter in PAM signals (since the slew rate for an 00-11 transition is different than
that for a 10-11 transition). The resulting recovered clock should still be adequate for protocol decoding, however a
better edge detector will need to be implemented in order to do adequate jitter measurements on PAM waveforms. An edge
detector suitable for PAM is planned (\issue{scopehal}{77}).

The current implementation of this filter uses a simple bang-bang control loop which is fast and provides reasonable
jitter transfer performance (passing high frequency jitter but rejecting spread spectrum modulation), but does not
precisely match the jitter transfer characteristics of any particular serial data standard. In the future, several
standard PLL responses including the Fibre Channel golden PLL (\issue{scopehal}{163}) will be supported as options.

\section{Clock Recovery (UART)}
\label{filter:cdruart}

This filter uses a DLL to recover a sampling clock from UART or similar protocol at a known baud rate. The single-rate
recovered clock idles low and toggles for each bit in each frame and is phased 90\textdegree with respect to data, such
that each bit can be sampled on the rising edge of the DLL output clock. This filter can be used for generating an eye
pattern of the serial signal.

The current implementation limits support to serial protocols with 10 bits/symbols per frame. Consider using the
\hyperref[filter:cdrpll]{PLL-based clock recovery} for unsupported serial formats if applicable.

The current implementation does not synchronize by aligning falling clock edges with symbol edges.

\section{DDJ}
\label{filter:ddj}

Calculates the peak-to-peak data-dependent jitter for a serial data stream.

This filter uses the non-repeating-pattern method, which allows DDJ to be computed for arbitrary waveforms rather than
requiring a short, repeating PRBS. In this method, per-UI jitter (TIE) measurements are split across $2^n$ histogram
bins, one for each possible combination of the preceding $n$ bits. The jitter samples for each bin are then averaged to
remove the effects of other jitter, leaving only the DDJ.  The final DDJ value is reported as the difference between
the minimum and maximum histogram bins.

The current implementation uses a fixed window size of $n=8$ UI. If the channel has significant memory effects or
reflections with delays of more than 8 UI, DDJ maybe underestimated.

The current implementation only supports NRZ signals and cannot measure DDJ for MLT3 or PAM waveforms.

\section{De-Embed}
\label{filter:deembed}

Applies the inverse of a channel (described by a single path in an S-parameter dataset, normally $S_{21}$) to a signal,
in order to calculate what the waveform would have looked like at the input to a cable, fixture, etc. given the signal
seen at the output.

The channel model works in the frequency domain. An FFT is performed on the input, then each complex point is scaled by
the interpolated magnitude and rotated by the phase, then an inverse FFT is used to transform the signal back into the
time domain.

The group delay of the channel is then estimated and samples are discarded from the end of the waveform to prevent
causality violations. For example, when performing a de-embed using a network with a 1ns group delay, the output
waveform will end 1ns before the input does (since the channel output after this depends on input samples after the end
of the stimulus waveform). Note that the automatic group delay estimation uses points from roughly the center of the
S-parameter dataset in the current implementation; channels which do not have a significant passband around this
frequency will give incorrect group delay estimates. The ``Group Delay Truncation Mode" parameter can be set to manual
in this case, selecting the ``Group Delay Truncation" parameter instead of the automatically estimated value.

Note that only the single S-parameter path provided is considered, and reflections elsewhere in the system are not
modeled. As a result, multiple applications of this filter to de-embed a large circuit piecewise (for example, a cable
followed by a probe) may give inaccurate results since reflections between the two networks are not considered. In this
situation, it is preferable to use a circuit simulator or the \hyperref[filter:sparamcascade]{S-Parameter Cascade}
filter to calculate combined S-parameters of the entire circuit and then perform a single de-embed.

The maximum gain the de-embed applies is capped (default 20 dB) in order to prevent amplifying noise outside the
passband of the network being de-embedded.

Applies a FIR low-pass filter to a signal to increase the vertical resolution and reduce noise at the cost of reduced

whose true value is midway between two ADC codes will randomly fluctuate between the two quantized values, with an
average equal to the true value.

Each half bit of resolution reduces the bandwidth by an additional factor of two beyond the Nyquist limit. For example,
a 1.5 bit resolution improvement reduces the bandwith to Fnyquist / 8. The filter properties dialog displays the
calculated -3 dB bandwidth based on the current input sample rate.

\section{FSK}

Converts a frequency-vs-time waveform (typically generated by the \hyperref[filter:vector_frequency]{Vector Frequency}
filter either directly or through a denoising filter) to a digital waveform. As of now, only BFSK is supported.

The filter calculates a histogram of the input signal each waveform, expecting a bimodal distribution. The two highest
histogram peaks are selected as the nominal logic 0 and 1 levels, with the higher frequency assigned to logic 1 and the
lower to logic 0.

Thresholding is performed at the midpoint of the nominal 0 and 1 levels, with hysteresis equal to 20\% of the
difference between the nominal levels. Using adaptive thresholds allows the filter to automatically track
frequency-hopping systems as long as only one packet is present in each waveform.

\section{Histogram}
\label{filter:histogram}

Computes a histogram from incoming data. Histogram counts are accumulated across multiple processed waveforms and cleared
on "Clear Sweeps." Number of histogram bins is determined from the bin size parameter and the max/min values configured.
Default behavior is to autorange the input and have 100fs bins. Samples outside a configured manual range will fall into
the highest/lowest bin and the "CLIPPING" flag will be set on the output waveform.

the driver in response to channels with significant reflection is not currently modeled.

IBIS-AMI is not currently supported, however this is planned (\issue{scopehal}{192}).

Random jitter is unbounded and has a Gaussian distribution with a user-specified standard deviation. Periodic jitter is

Given a phase angle waveform, outputs the difference between the actual phase and linear phase. A perfectly linear

The nominal linear phase response is calculated based on the averge group delay between two user-supplied frequencies.
Moving the reference frequencies further apart reduces the impact of phase noise in the data (since more points are
being averaged) however both points must be located well within the linear region of the network in order to give
accurate results.

\section{SWD}

The Serial Wire Debug protocol between a Debug Probe and an ARM Microcontroller, typically from the CORTEX-M family. This
decode recognises all SWD frame elements and validates type and parity of both incoming and outgoing messages. It also
identifies line resets and line protocol change messages.

The SWD Protocol defines that the target will read and write on the rising edge of SWCLK. It does not place any constraint
on when the probe reads and writes. For the purposes of graphical depiction each protocol element starts at a falling edge
and continues to be valid until the next falling edge, following the graphical convention established in the ARM documentation.

Reference: ARM Debug Interface v5 Architecture Specification, Chapter 4.
