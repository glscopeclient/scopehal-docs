\subsection{siglent\_ssg}

This driver was developed on a SSG5060X-V and should support the other models in the SSG5000X family (SSG5040X,
SSG5060X, and SSG5040X-V). It is unknown whether it will function at all with the SSG3000X or 5000A families in its
current state; additional development will likely be needed for full support.
