\subsection{uhd}

This driver connects via a TCP socket to a socket server
\href{https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-uhd-bridge}{scopehal-uhd-bridge} which connects to the appropriate
instrument using the UHD API.

This provides network transparency for USB-attached instruments, as well as a license boundary between the BSD-licensed
libscopehal core and the GPL-licensed UHD API.

\section{Microphase}

The AntSDR running antsdr\_uhd firmware is supported by the ``uhd" driver for Ettus Research SDRs. There is currently no
support for the IIO firmware.
